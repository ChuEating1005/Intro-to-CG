## Final Project: [Treasure Hunt](https://github.com/ChuEating1005/Treasure-Hunt)  
A 30-second 3D animation project built using OpenGL. Leveraged free Minecraft-style models and manually preprocessed body parts in Blender to enable character articulation. All movement and animation logic were programmed from scratch, resulting in a cinematic short rendered in real time. Result [video link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwIccvUqtNY).
